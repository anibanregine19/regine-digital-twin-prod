## Understanding the Architecture

Your Digital Twin consists of four main components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      YOUR DIGITAL TWIN                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                               │
│  1. Frontend (Vercel)          ← Hosts your website         │
│  2. Database (Neon)            ← Stores chat logs           │
│  3. Vector DB (Upstash)        ← Stores your knowledge      │
│  4. AI Brain (Groq)            ← Generates responses        │
│                                                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How it works:**
1. A visitor asks a question on your website
2. The question is sent to Upstash to find relevant information about you
3. That information is sent to Groq AI to generate a natural response
4. The conversation is logged in Neon database for analytics
5. The response is shown to the visitor

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Accounts

### 1.1 GitHub Account
- **Already done!** ✅ You have this repository

### 1.2 Vercel Account (Hosting Platform)
1. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub"
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
5. Complete your profile

**Why Vercel?** It's free for personal projects and automatically deploys your code when you push to GitHub.

---

## Step 2: Configure Your Database

### 2.1 Create a Neon PostgreSQL Database

**What is Neon?** A serverless PostgreSQL database that stores your chat logs and analytics.

1. Go to [https://neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Click "Sign Up" → Choose "Continue with GitHub"
3. After signing in, click "Create a project"
4. Configure your project:
   - **Project name**: `regine-digital-twin-db` (or your preferred name)
   - **PostgreSQL version**: 16 (or latest)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your target audience
5. Click "Create Project"

### 2.2 Get Your Database Connection String

1. On your Neon dashboard, you'll see a "Connection Details" section
2. Copy the **Connection string** (it looks like this):
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/database_name?sslmode=require
   ```
3. **Save this somewhere safe** - you'll need it in Step 6

**Important:** This connection string contains your password. Never share it publicly!

### 2.3 Database Tables

Don't worry about creating tables manually! The application automatically creates these tables on first run:
- `chat_logs` - Stores all conversations
- `popular_questions` - Tracks frequently asked questions

---

## Step 3: Set Up Vector Database

### 3.1 Create an Upstash Vector Database

**What is Upstash Vector?** A database that stores your professional information in a way that AI can quickly search through it.

1. Go to [https://console.upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" → Choose "Continue with GitHub"
3. After signing in, click "Create Database"
4. Choose "Vector Database"
5. Configure your database:
   - **Name**: `regine-digital-twin-vector`
   - **Region**: Same as your Neon database (for better performance)
   - **Dimensions**: 1536 (for OpenAI embeddings)
   - **Similarity Function**: COSINE
6. Click "Create"

### 3.2 Get Your Upstash Credentials

1. On your Upstash Vector database page, find the "REST API" section
2. Copy two values:
   - **UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL**: `https://xxx-xxx-xxx.upstash.io`
   - **UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN**: `Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
3. **Save these somewhere safe** - you'll need them in Step 6

### 3.3 Populate Your Vector Database

You need to add your professional information to the vector database. This requires:

**Option A: Use the included data** (Recommended for testing)
- The repository includes `mytwin_refined.json` with sample data
- You'll need to run a script to upload this to Upstash
- See "Local Development" section below

**Option B: Prepare your own data**
- Create a JSON file with your professional information
- Include: experiences, skills, achievements, etc.
- See `mytwin_refined.json` as a template

---

## Step 4: Get AI API Access

### 4.1 Create a Groq Account

**What is Groq?** A fast AI API service that generates natural language responses.

1. Go to [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" → Enter your email
3. Verify your email
4. Complete the signup process

### 4.2 Get Your API Key

1. In Groq Console, click on "API Keys" in the left menu
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name: `digital-twin-api`
4. Click "Create"
5. **Copy the API key** (starts with `gsk_`)
6. **Save this somewhere safe** - you'll need it in Step 6

**Important:** You can't see the API key again after closing the dialog!

### 4.3 Groq Free Tier

Groq offers a generous free tier:
- Perfect for personal projects
- Fast response times
- No credit card required initially

---

## Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

Now let's deploy your Digital Twin to Vercel!

### 5.1 Import Your Repository

1. Go to [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Find your GitHub repository: `regine-digital-twin-prod`
4. Click "Import"

### 5.2 Configure Build Settings

Vercel should automatically detect:
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: (leave empty)
- **Output Directory**: (leave empty)

If not, manually select "Other" as the framework.

### 5.3 Don't Deploy Yet!

Click "Expand" next to "Environment Variables" - we'll add them in the next step.

**Important:** Don't click "Deploy" yet! We need to add environment variables first.

---

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

Environment variables are secure settings that tell your app how to connect to services.

### 6.1 Add Environment Variables in Vercel

In the Vercel deployment page, add these four variables:

#### Variable 1: DATABASE_URL
- **Key**: `DATABASE_URL`
- **Value**: Your Neon connection string (from Step 2.2)
- **Example**: `postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/db?sslmode=require`

#### Variable 2: UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL
- **Key**: `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`
- **Value**: Your Upstash URL (from Step 3.2)
- **Example**: `https://xxx-xxx-xxx.upstash.io`

#### Variable 3: UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN
- **Key**: `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN`
- **Value**: Your Upstash token (from Step 3.2)
- **Example**: `Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Variable 4: GROQ_API_KEY
- **Key**: `GROQ_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your Groq API key (from Step 4.2)
- **Example**: `gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### 6.2 Deploy!

1. After adding all four environment variables, click "Deploy"
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for the deployment to complete
3. You'll see a "Congratulations!" message when done

---

## Step 7: Test Your Deployment

### 7.1 Get Your Deployment URL

After deployment, Vercel will show you a URL like:
```
https://regine-digital-twin-prod.vercel.app
```

Or:
```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

### 7.2 Test the Health Endpoint

Open your browser and visit:
```
https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/health
```

✅ **Expected result:** You should see JSON showing system status:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000000",
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "vector_db": "connected",
    "groq_api": "configured"
  }
}
```

❌ **If you see errors:**
- `database: "error"` → Check your DATABASE_URL in Vercel settings
- `vector_db: "error"` → Check your Upstash credentials
- `groq_api: "not_configured"` → Check your GROQ_API_KEY

### 7.3 Test the API Endpoint

Visit:
```
https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/test
```

✅ **Expected result:**
```json
{
  "message": "Regine's Digital Twin API is working!",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000000",
  "version": "2.1",
  "features": ["AI Chat", "Analytics", "Vector Search"],
  "status": "serverless_optimized"
}
```

### 7.4 Test the Home Endpoint

Visit:
```
https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/
```

✅ **Expected result:** Information about available endpoints

### 7.5 Test the Chat Functionality

To test the AI chat, you can use a tool like Postman or curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Tell me about yourself"}'
```

Or use this JavaScript in your browser console:
```javascript
fetch('https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/query', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: "Tell me about yourself" })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

✅ **Expected result:** An AI-generated response about you
